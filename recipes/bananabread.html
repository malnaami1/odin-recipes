        <li>2 Cups All Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1 Cup Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray or grease with butter and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the stick of butter to a large bowl and microwave for 1 minute, or until melted.</li>
        <li>Add the bananas to the same bowl and mash with a fork.</li>
        <li>Add the vanilla extract and egg to the bowl and use the same fork to mash and stir until no yellow streaks of egg remain.</li>
        <li>In a second large bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix together with a spatula just until combined</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into prepared loaf pan and bake for 45-55 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.</li>
    </ol>
