    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Best chocolate fudge brownie recipe is here!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (120g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (43g) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon espresso powder [optional, don't use if you don't like coffee]</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons (28ml) oil canola, vegetable, or coconut will work</li>
        <li>1 and 1/3 cups (265g) granulated sugar divided</li>
        <li>2 large large eggs</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (128 grams) chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees (F) (175 degreed C). Line an 9Ã—9-inch baking pan with parchment paper. Spray lightly with non-stick baking spray and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cocoa powder, and espresso powder. Set aside until needed. </li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the butter, oil, and 1/3 cup of the sugar. Heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, until butter is completely melted. Remove from heat. </li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs and remaining sugar. Whisk until well combined, about 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Slowly, pour the warm butter mixture into the egg mixture, adding it very gradually (a little bit at a time) and whisking constantly until completely combined. </li>
        <li>Add in the dry ingredients and chocolate chips and, using a rubber spatula, slowly stir until just combined. *Do not over mix! Stop stirring when you see the last trace of dry ingredients. Over mixing will give you cakey brownies. </li>
        <li>Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. </li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes, or until the edges are firm and the top is shiny and slightly cracked. </li>
        <li>Place pan on a cooling rack and cool completely before slicing. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy your delicious brownies!</p>
