    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 sticks Unsalted butter, melted 226 grams</li>
        <li>1 Eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp Vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Milk</li>
        <li>3 cups All purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp Kosher salt</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp Baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp Cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Cinnamon></li>
        <li>4 oz Semi sweet chocolate</li>
        <li>4 oz Milk chocolate (you can substitute the milk chocolate for dark if you'd like)</li>
        <li>8 oz Extra chocolate of your choice to top your cookies with before you bake them (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (177°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper, or prep with baking spray.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter using the stove (make sure its on low heat!) or the microwave.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until light and fluffy using an electric mixer or a whisk for about 4 - 6 minutes. Make sure your melted butter is NOT hot or it will melt your chocolate!</li>
        <li>Add in the eggs, one at a time, and mix until fully incorporated. Stir in the vanilla extract and milk.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li>Chop up the semi sweet, and milk chocolate. You can use chocolate chips instead, if you'd like.</li>
        <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop dough balls onto the prepared baking sheet. Make sure to leave enough space between each cookie to allow for spreading while baking.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies for 12-14 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the center is set, but be careful not to over bake them. Even if they seem a bit underdone after 14 minutes, take them out of the oven as they will continue to set while they cool down.</li>
        <li>Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Sprinkle them with flaky salt.</li>
    </ol>
